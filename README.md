# Fred Myers and the Moonpetal Marsh

Fred Myers is a story-driven frog adventure currently playable as a five-level browser prototype. This repository is the independent Fred product repository within **The Flins App Vault**. Fred consumes shared platform capabilities from `mobile-game-core`; Fred-specific movement, predators, environments, story, levels, tuning, and assets stay here.

## Current milestone

Discovery and Godot migration readiness are complete. The browser prototype remains the playable reference, and the `godot/` directory is deliberately only a compatibility scaffold. No claim is made that the Godot game has been implemented or that a mobile build has been produced.

- Play: https://fred-myers-moonpetal-marsh.tommyheflin.chatgpt.site/
- Current repository: https://github.com/tommyheflin1/fred-myers-moonpetal-marsh
- Preferred future name: `tommyheflin1/fred-myers-adventure` (rename only with owner approval and after link-impact review)
- Engine target: Godot `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`
- Core pin: Mobile Game Core `0.5.1`
- Save schema proposal: `fred_save` version `1`

## Repository role

The App Vault remains a collection of independently releasable repositories:

```text
The Flins App Vault/
  mobile-game-core/
  mobile-game-template/
  shared-game-backend/
  snake-reactor/
  fred-myers-adventure/
```

This repository owns Fred gameplay. Core owns only reusable, game-neutral services. The backend is optional and injected; the complete story must remain playable offline without an account.

## Minimal Godot scaffold

`godot/project.godot` proves the intended engine/project boundary and `godot/CORE_VERSION` records the dependency pin. It intentionally contains no gameplay scene, copied Core add-on, export preset, or signing configuration. The first implementation milestone must start from the current `mobile-game-template`, vendor the exact Core 0.5.1 snapshot, and then add Fred-owned code outside `addons/mobile_game_core`.

## Legacy source

`fred-myers-source.zip` is the original GitHub-uploaded browser source artifact. The deployed site and the separately maintained Sites checkout are the current runtime reference. Do not treat the zip as a reproducible Godot project.
